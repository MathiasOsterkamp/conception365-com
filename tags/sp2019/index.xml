      <description>Managed Metadata Migration Managed metadata is a formal taxonomy classification system. A taxonomy groups the words, labels, and terms that describe something, and then arranges the groups into a hierarchy. You can learn more basics and wordings on microsoft docs. Mostly it is simple called term store.
