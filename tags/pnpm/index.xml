With every new project we have to download everything again. I started to look for a better solution and found pnpm.
Solution pnpm is a complete custom package manager designed for better performance, but compatible with npm. Instead of heaving multiple packages it uses symlinks and reuses packages. They published a speed comparison, in some tests it is pretty fast, especial if you already have some projects.</description></item></channel></rss>
