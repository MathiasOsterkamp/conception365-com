The challenge is the correct configuration for the site with powershell and also create the correct terms. With the script you can set the amount of navigation entries.

Terms mostly get orphaned, if you reuse terms and delete the original instances. There is a very good explanation from Mike Morawski how this could happen.
Not long ago I was working away with the term store though Powershell. I had to remove all of a particular group’s termsets and to do this I ended up calling the Group’s delete function.</description></item></channel></rss>
