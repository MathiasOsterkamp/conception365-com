As part of the PnP initiative, PowerShell commands have been developed to simplify the management and automation of tasks within these ecosystems. This collection of PowerShell cmdlets is known as Microsoft PnP PowerShell. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the documentation resources available for Microsoft PnP PowerShell, providing developers with a valuable guide to mastering this powerful toolset.</description></item><item><title>Powershell - Create Navigation</title><link>https://conception365.com/post/2021-11-01-powershell-create-navigation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://conception365.com/post/2021-11-01-powershell-create-navigation/</guid><description>Managed Navigation with Powershell Goal Our goal is a complete setup for a test site collection with managed metadata navigation and existing pages with different levels. The challenge is the correct configuration for the site with powershell and also create the correct terms. With the script you can set the amount of navigation entries.

If you like to migrate to another SharePoint version or different server maybe you like to transfer these links without copy the database. In general these links are stored in the ProfileDB of your server. There is a smart article about this from Vinods source.
Here a small sample, where you can edit links:

Terms mostly get orphaned, if you reuse terms and delete the original instances. There is a very good explanation from Mike Morawski how this could happen.
Not long ago I was working away with the term store though Powershell. I had to remove all of a particular group’s termsets and to do this I ended up calling the Group’s delete function.</description></item></channel></rss>
