You have full access to the source code inside Office 365 PowerApps.
Custom connector In general in PowerApps you need a data source for every app. This can be done by custom entities or with connectors. O365 brings you a lot of default connectors, if you have a third party system like SevDesk, you can create your own connector.</description></item><item><title>PowerApps TimeTracking for SevDesk</title><link>https://conception365.com/post/2021-04-30-powerapps-sevdesk-guide/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://conception365.com/post/2021-04-30-powerapps-sevdesk-guide/</guid><description>I was looking for a smart and simple mobile time tracking solution connected to SevDesk.
