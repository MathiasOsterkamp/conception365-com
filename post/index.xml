SevDesk has no mobile solution for time tracking module. Existing third party apps where not fully fit my requirements. I was satisfied with the default module and implemented a mobile app with Office 365 - PowerApps.

This was done a while a go, but I decided now to publish the sources to help you build your own.</description></item><item><title>SPFX 2019 eslint and prettier</title><link>https://conception365.com/post/2021-04-22-spfx-2019-prettier-eslint/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://conception365.com/post/2021-04-22-spfx-2019-prettier-eslint/</guid><description>SPFX 2019 eslint and prettier For our current projects we used tslint and suffered for some problems. First main concern was, that VSCode was not able to give full feedback about code problems. Later on execution of gulp build all errors where thrown. Furthermore we got some conflicts with prettier solution and it was a hell to understand the current used rules from tslint. Also the tslint performance was very awful.</description></item><item><title>Remove Managed Metadata Orphaned Terms</title><link>https://conception365.com/post/2021-02-11-orphaned-terms/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://conception365.com/post/2021-02-11-orphaned-terms/</guid><description>Remove Managed Metadata Orphaned Terms Problem In some cases you like to get rid of orphaned terms. Terms mostly get orphaned, if you reuse terms and delete the original instances. There is a very good explanation from Mike Morawski how this could happen.
Not long ago I was working away with the term store though Powershell.

A taxonomy groups the words, labels, and terms that describe something, and then arranges the groups into a hierarchy. You can learn more basics and wordings on microsoft docs. Mostly it is simple called term store.
Where are my data stored? The first common question for migration is, where actual the term store data are stored. The short answer is, everything important is stored in Managed Metadata SQL Database of the service application.</description></item></channel></rss>
